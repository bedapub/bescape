    "# BESCAPE - tutorial on deconvolution of bulk RNA using single-cell annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "BESCAPE (BESCA Proportion Estimator) is a deconvolution module. It utilises single-cell annotations coming from the BESCA workflow to build a Gene Expression Profile (GEP). This GEP is used as a basis vector to deconvolute bulk RNA samples i.e. predict cell type proportions within a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "BESCAPE has a useful implementation, whereby the user can specify their own GEP, as well as choose any of the supported deconvolution methods. Thus, it effectively allows decoupling of the deconvolution algorithm from its underlying GEP (basis vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial presents the workflow for deconvolution, as well as the link to BESCA single-cell annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that either Docker or Singularity services have already been installed."

    "To initiate the Bescape deconvolution object, we to set the service to 'docker' and docker_image='bedapub/bescape:version'. It will first look for local docker images, and if not available, will pull the bescape image from DockerHub. This also means that one can locally build a customised Docker image from the BESCAPE source and set use it in the Bescape object.\n",
